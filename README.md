## Beard

*Beard* is a TUI library for C++11.

## Dependencies

Beard uses:

1. [duct++](https://github.com/komiga/duct-cpp) (HEAD)
2. [ceformat](https://github.com/komiga/ceformat) (HEAD)
3. [All the Mathsâ€½](https://github.com/komiga/am) (HEAD)

See `dep/README.md` for dependency setup.

## Building

Beard is a compiled shared library (by default).

All features support Clang 3.5+ with libc++ (SVN head). GCC is not supported
due to the ceformat dependency. This may be alleviated in the near future, but
Beard is currently in heavy development, so expect things to break often.

Once dependencies are setup (see `dep/README.md`), the library and tests can be
compiled using plash's standard project protocol: http://komiga.com/pp-cpp
